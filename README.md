<b>Homestead</b> is a crypto system to provide subsizided interest rates for mortgages. The system allows borrowers to mint tokens that represent lines of credit.  These tokens can then be sold by the borrower in order to purchase a home or pay off previous financing.  Over time, the borrower will repurchase the token from the market to pay off their loans, burning the token. 

The protocol consists of two core components: subsidized credit tokens (Georgies) representing debt obligations and a fee tokens (Henries) that help to subsidize interest rates and provide a mechanism for price stability. This whitepaper outlines the protocol's mechanics, economic incentives, regulatory considerations, and risk factors.
